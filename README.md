# Introduction
Welcome to the Translation Management Serviceâ€”a Laravel-based application designed to store, manage, and serve translations for multiple locales. The service focuses on clean architecture, performance, and scalability, leveraging SOLID principles and repository/service patterns. By integrating caching, API resources, and advanced testing, it ensures both robust functionality and a maintainable codebase.
